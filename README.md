# KubeJS-Chest-Cavity-Organ-Builder
Allows you to register items as Chest Cavity Organs and assign them OrganScores in an easy to use format.

For a list of valid OrganScores, refer to [CC Organ Scores](https://github.com/Tigereye504/chestcavity/blob/master/src/main/java/net/tigereye/chestcavity/registration/CCOrganScores.java)

Very special thanks to A5TR0spud for allowing us to use his mod's spritework for these examplary organs!
